<ul><font size = 5 face = Helvetica color = b71d53>
<li>I learned that I should be more aware of my surroundings, during the cooking I notice that I was a bit too focused on what I was doing.</li>
<li>I learned that making the dough is largely trial and error, the glutinous rice flour became the right clay-like consistency very quickly but a lot stayed as the flour. We spent around 10 minutes adding water and glutinous rice flour trying to get the dough right.</lI>
<li>I learned that bbq sticks cannot hold up palitaw very well, I also learned that the palitaw stick to the bbq stick like glue.</li>
